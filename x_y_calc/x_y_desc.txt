This was a complicated answer to a simple question. I was really big into math, and took a huge leap in understanding. I jumped about 1 or 2 grades to be in a high level math class, but had to do some work with factoring equations. Stuff like 2x = y, so I learned a bit of sympy to do the work for me! I later went on to do more and more complicated equations using python, but this was my start. I eventually came around and updated this project to include solving for x and y, not just both. It is very slow, and inneffective, but I am proud of what I was able to accomplish, even with so little knowledge compared to what knowledge I have now.
