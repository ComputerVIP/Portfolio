This was an idea I had while on a trip back from Hawaii. I had the idea to download some Youtube videos so I could watch them on the plane, and tried to use Replit's Agent to make the program in about an hour. In the end, it didn't work (because of compatibility issues with a phone and I didn't have a laptop on hand) and I decided to just watch some different shows. I came back to it later with the same determination to download videos, but also allow me to download all of a channel's videos. This was ambitious and took a lot of hard work to make it work, but I eventually got an mp4 downloader for Youtube, I had to have some help from ChatGPT, as it was slightly outside my skill level, but it works now. I don't use it, but am proud of it.
