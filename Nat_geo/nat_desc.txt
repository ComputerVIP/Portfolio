This was another personal project I did, this is fully customisable to download links, text, and images from nat geo premium articles. The idea came from one article I really wanted to read, but it was locked under a panel that asked me to sign in. I tried many different things to get the article, but then decided I wanted to grab the entire thing. I am now able to read which articles I please and have learned a lot about web surfing, and data mining from this.
