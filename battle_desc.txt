This was a project required for my CS1400 class, I had made a previous version of this project, but the assignment was to update this project. I had recently learned Tkinter, and one of the requirements was an, "updated menu" which I decided to pursue. I made the entire game using Tkinter's libraries and it looked so cool, come to find out, she just meant that I had to update the menu with some other new requirements. I got 5 extra credit points and am most proud of this. It took a lot of time, and so much work, but this ambitious dream came to reality, in about 2 hours, just before midnight.
